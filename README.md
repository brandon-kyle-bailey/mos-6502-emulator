# Virtual emulator of the MOS 6502 8 bit microprocessor

## Motivation

In an effort to re-familiarize myself with low-level programming and computer architecture, I embarked on a project to create a virtual emulator of the MOS 6502 microprocessor. The 6502 is a classic 8-bit microprocessor that powered many early computers and gaming consoles, making it an ideal candidate for this endeavor. Naturally, It's written in C++.
